Assignment: Tensors and a tiny neural network

Instructions:
1. Choose PyTorch or Keras
2. Keep the model small and run quickly
3. Explain what each block does

# Task 1: Tensor operations
# TODO: Create a tensor with shape (2, 3)
# TODO: Reshape to (3, 2)
# TODO: Demonstrate broadcasting with another tensor

# Task 2: Build a tiny neural network
# TODO: Use MNIST or iris (flattened)
# TODO: Build a model with:
# - 1 hidden layer (ReLU)
# - output layer (softmax or sigmoid)
# TODO: Train for a few epochs and print accuracy

# Task 3: Compare APIs
# TODO: Write 4-6 comment lines on:
# - where PyTorch feels lower level
# - where Keras feels higher level

print("Done! You built and trained a simple neural network.")
