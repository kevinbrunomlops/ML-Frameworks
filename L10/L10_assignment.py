Lektion 10 - Forenklade processer (Lightning / fastai)
Assignment: Reduce boilerplate in training loops

Instructions:
1. Start from a plain PyTorch training loop
2. Refactor to Lightning OR implement with fastai
3. Compare code length and readability
"""

# Task 1: Baseline PyTorch loop
# TODO: Build a small model and training loop in PyTorch
# TODO: Train for a few epochs and record accuracy

# Task 2: Refactor with Lightning OR fastai
# TODO: Convert the loop into a LightningModule (or a fastai Learner)
# TODO: Train the same model and record accuracy

# Task 3: Compare
# TODO: Write 4-6 comment lines about:
# - what boilerplate disappeared
# - what became easier or harder to debug

print("Done! You simplified training with higher-level tools.")
