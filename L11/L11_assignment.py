Lektion 11 - Prestandaoptimering och fine-tuning
Assignment: Transfer learning and data pipeline tuning

Instructions:
1. Use a pretrained model (e.g., ResNet18)
2. Compare frozen vs fine-tuned performance
3. Measure small performance tweaks
"""

# Task 1: Transfer learning
# TODO: Load a pretrained model
# TODO: Freeze the base layers
# TODO: Train a new classifier head
# TODO: Record accuracy

# Task 2: Fine-tuning
# TODO: Unfreeze part of the base
# TODO: Train again and record accuracy
# TODO: Compare with Task 1

# Task 3: Dataloader tuning
# TODO: Test at least two of:
# - num_workers
# - pin_memory
# - prefetch_factor
# TODO: Record training time for 1-2 epochs

print("Done! You explored fine-tuning and performance tuning.")
